# Sudoku
a C++ program that solves a Sudoku board

It is a piece of college coursework.
The functions including is_complete(), make_move(), save_board(), solve_board() and its corrospending helper functions were written by myself. The others were pre-supplied. 

Executable file is not provided but simply running makefile will able to produce one and hence run the program as well.
